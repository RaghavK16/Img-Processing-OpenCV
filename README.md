# K-Means_Img_Segmentation_Proj
## Image segmentation:
It is an important step in image processing, and its used everywhere if we want to analyze whatâ€™s inside the image. For example, if we seek to find if there is a chair or person inside an indoor image, we may need image segmentation to separate objects and analyze each object individually to check what it is.

Image segmentation is the classification of an image into different groups. Many kinds of research have been done in the area of image segmentation using clustering. There are different methods and one of the most popular methods is K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Canny Edge detection: 
It is an image processing method used to detect edges in an image while suppressing noise.
OpenCV provides cv2.Canny(image, threshold1,threshold2) function for edge detection. The first argument is our input image. Second and third arguments are our min and max threshold respectively.
